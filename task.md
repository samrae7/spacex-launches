#S paceX App

This test is to build an application that lists information about SpaceX rocket launches using
their free open SpaceX api:   

Make an application that lists the most recent 50 launches, for each launch the application
should show the launch name, date and details. The user should be able to sort by date and
launch name and to click ‘view rocket details’ to see rocket details. They should be able to
search by launch name. You are free to style the application how you think is best.
